# SnakeOilAndroid

This repo consists of the key files required to build the Android app for Snake Oil that I made, and a built version. An advantage of provising the source code (as it is fairly basic!) is that the list of cards can be freely customised in a way that would not be possible with real cards.

If you play the game a lot, remember to support the people who designed the game by buying a copy. It would make a great gift for family or friends!
